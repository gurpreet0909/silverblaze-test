I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo appeared.
He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a series of astronomical observations.
Then, when he had finished, he went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly on the ocean.
In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the Nautilus, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.
They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night.
These sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type was visible in all of them.
 I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen, Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote.
 They were civil, and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I could not guess, neither could I question them.

I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of fish.
It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at. Indeed, the nets are let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinite variety.
We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the Nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew our supply.
These several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the steward's room, some to be eaten fresh, and others pickled.
